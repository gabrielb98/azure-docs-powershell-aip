  The **Use-AipServiceKeyVaultKey** cmdlet tells Azure Information Protection to use a customer-managed key (BYOK) in Azure Key Vault.

  You must use PowerShell to configure your tenant key; you cannot do this configuration by using a management portal.

  You can run this cmdlet before or after the protection service (Azure Rights Management) is activated. 

  Before you run this cmdlet, make sure that the Azure Rights Management service principal has been granted permissions to the key vault that contains the key you want to use for Azure Information Protection. These permissions are granted by running the Azure Key Vault cmdlet, [Set-AzKeyVaultAccessPolicy](/powershell/module/az.keyvault/set-azkeyvaultaccesspolicy).

  For security reasons, the **Use-AipServiceKeyVaultKey** cmdlet does not let you set or change the access control for the key in Azure Key Vault. After that access is granted by running **Set-AzKeyVaultAccessPolicy**, run **Use-AipServiceKeyVaultKey** to tell Azure Information Protection to use the key and version that you specify with the *KeyVaultKeyUrl* parameter.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you run this cmdlet before the permissions are granted to the key vault, you will see an error that displays **The Rights Management service failed to add the key**. 
  >
  > To see more detailed information, run the command again, with -*Verbose*. If the permissions are not granted, you see **VERBOSE: Failure to access Azure KeyVault**.

  When your command successfully runs, the key is added as an archived customer-managed tenant key for Azure Information Protection for your organization. To make it the active tenant key for Azure Information Protection, you must then run the [Set-AipServiceKeyProperties](./Set-AipServiceKeyProperties.yml) cmdlet.

  Use Azure Key Vault to centrally manage and monitor use of the key that you specified. All calls to your tenant key will be made to the key vault that your organization owns. You can confirm which key you are using in Key Vault by using the [Get-AipServiceKeys](./Get-AipServiceKeys.yml) cmdlet.

  For more information about the types of tenant keys that Azure Information Protection supports, see [Planning and implementing your Azure Information Protection tenant key](/information-protection/plan-design/plan-implement-tenant-key).
