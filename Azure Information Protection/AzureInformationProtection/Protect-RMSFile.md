# Protect-RMSFile

## SYNOPSIS
Protects a specified file or the files in a specified folder by using RMS.

## SYNTAX

```
Protect-RMSFile [-File <String>] [-Folder <String>] [-InPlace] [-Recurse] [-TemplateID <String>]
 [-License <SafeInformationProtectionLicenseHandle>] [-DoNotPersistEncryptionKey <String>]
 [-OutputFolder <String>] [-OwnerEmail <String>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The **Protect-RMSFile** cmdlet protects a file or all files in a specified folder by using Azure RMS or AD RMS. If the file was previously protected, it will be protected again, to apply any changes such as those that might be made to the template that is being used to protect the file.

Multiple file types can be protected in the same way that the Azure Information Protection client can protect files when you use the "Classify and protect" right-click option from File Explorer. Different levels of protection are automatically applied (native or generic), depending on the file type. You can change the level of protection by editing the registry. In addition, some files change their file name extension after they are protected by Rights Management. For more information, see the [File types supported for protection](/information-protection/rms-client/client-admin-guide-file-types#file-types-supported-for-protection) section from the Azure Information Protection client admin guide.

Before you run this cmdlet, you must run [Get-RMSTemplate](./Get-RMSTemplate.md) to download the templates onto your computer. If the template that you want to use has been modified since you ran this cmdlet, run it again with the **-force** parameter to download the revised template.

When you run this cmdlet, you have the following options:

- The file is protected in the current location, replacing the original file that was unprotected.

- The original file remains unprotected and a protected version of the file is created in another location.

- All files in the specified folder are protected in the current location, replacing the original files that were unprotected.

- All files in the specified folder remains unprotected and a protected version of each file is created in another location.

You cannot run this command concurrently but must wait for the original command to complete before running it again. If you try to run it again before the previous command has finished, the new command will fail.

This cmdlet writes to the following log files: **Success.log**, **Failure.log**, and **Debug.log** in %localappdata%\Microsoft\MSIPC\pscmdlet\Logs\\<GUID>.

Tip: For step-by-step instructions to use this cmdlet to protect files on a Windows Server file share, using File Resource Manager and File Classification Infrastructure, see [RMS Protection with Windows Server File Classification Infrastructure (FCI)](/information-protection/rms-client/configure-fci).

This cmdlet is not supported for the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Protect and replace a single file by using a template
```
PS C:\>Protect-RMSFile -File "C:\Test.docx" -InPlace -TemplateID 82bf3474-6efe-4fa1-8827-d1bd93339119
InputFile             EncryptedFile
---------             -------------
C:\Test.docx          C:\Test.docx
```

This command protects a single file named Test.docx by using a template, and replaces the original unprotected file. The Rights Management owner of the file, and the email address that might be displayed to users when they access the protected file, is automatically set as the email address for the account running the command.

### Example 2: Create a protected copy of a single file by using a template
```
PS C:\>Protect-RMSFile -File "Test.docx" -TemplateID 82bf3474-6efe-4fa1-8827-d1bd93339119
InputFile             EncryptedFile
---------             -------------
C:\Test.docx          C:\Test-Copy.docx
```

This command is the same as the previous example, except that it doesn't use the InPlace parameter. Because it also doesn't use the OutputFolder parameter, the protected file is created in the current folder with "-Copy" appended to the file name. The original, unprotected file remains in the current folder.

### Example 3: Create a protected version of a file by using a template
```
PS C:\>Protect-RMSFile -File "C:\Test.docx" -OutputFolder "C:\Temp" -TemplateID e6ee2481-26b9-45e5-b34a-f744eacd53b0 -OwnerEmail "admin@Contoso.com"

InputFile             EncryptedFile
---------             -------------
C:\Test.txt           C:\Temp\Test.ptxt
```

This command protects a single file named Test.docx by using a template and places this protected version of the file in C:\Temp, leaving the original file unprotected in the root of the C: drive. The Rights Management owner of the file, and the email address that might be displayed to users when they access the protected file, is for the administrator.

### Example 4: Protected all files in a folder by using a template
```
PS C:\>Protect-RMSFile -Folder "\\server1\Docs" -InPlace -DoNotPersistEncryptionKey All -TemplateID e6ee2481-26b9-45e5-b34a-f744eacd53b0 -OwnerEmail "IT@Contoso.com"

InputFile                        EncryptedFile

----------                       -------------
\\server1\Docs\Feb2015.docx      \\server1\Docs\Feb2015.docx

\\server1\Docs\Feb2015.txt       \\server1\Docs\Feb2015.ptxt

\\server1\Docs\Jan2015.docx      \\server1\Docs\Jan2015.docx

\\server1\Docs\Jan2015.txt       \\server1\Docs\Jan2015.ptxt
```

This command protects all files in a server share (single folder only, not subfolders), replacing the unprotected files. The email address that is displayed to users when they do not have access, is for the IT department group and this group is granted Full Control usage rights in the template so that they can change the usage rights for the protected files. 

Because this scenario is protecting files on behalf of others, the *DoNotPersistEncryptionKey* parameter is used for maximum performance and to prevent unused files from being saved to disk.

### Example 5: Protected files with a specific file name extension in a folder by using a template
```
PS C:\>foreach ($file in (Get-ChildItem -Path \\server1\Docs -Recurse -Force | where {!$_.PSIsContainer} | Where-Object {$_.Extension -eq ".docx"})) {Protect-RMSFile -File $file.PSPath -InPlace -DoNotPersistEncryptionKey All -TemplateID "e6ee2481-26b9-45e5-b34a-f744eacd53b0" -OwnerEmail "IT@Contoso.com"}


InputFile                                   EncryptedFile

---------                                   -------------
\\server1\Docs\Feb2015.docx                 \\server1\Docs\Feb2015.docx

\\server1\Docs\Jan2015.docx                 \\server1\Docs\Jan2015.docx

\\server1\Docs\Reports\Feb2015.docx         \\server1\Docs\Reports\Feb2015.docx

\\server1\Docs\Reports\Jan2015.docx         \\server1\Docs\Reports\Jan2015.docx
```

This command protects only files that have a .docx file name extension in a folder (and all subfolders) on a server share, replacing the unprotected files. As in the previous example, the email address that is displayed to users when they do not have access, is for the IT department.

Although the [Protect-RMSFile](./Protect-RMSFile.md) command does not natively support wildcards, you can use Windows PowerShell to achieve this, and change the file name extension in the example, as required.

### Example 6: Protect a single file by using an ad-hoc rights policy
```
PS C:\>$License = New-RMSProtectionLicense -UserEmail 'user1@contoso.com' -Permission EDIT
PS C:\> Protect-RMSFile -License $License -File "C:\Test.txt" -InPlace
InputFile             EncryptedFile
---------             -------------
C:\Test.txt           C:\Test.ptxt
```

The first command creates an ad-hoc rights policy that grants Edit rights to user1@contoso.com.

The second command protects a single file named Test.txt by using this ad-hoc rights policy just created, and replaces the original unprotected file.

Note that unless your email address is user1@contoso.com, you will not be able to unprotect this file after the command completes because you do not have any rights to it and you are not the Rights Management owner. If you need to be able to unprotect this file later, you can add your name and grant the user and yourself either the EXTRACT or OWNER right in the ad-hoc rights policy in the first command. Or if you do not want the user to be able to unprotect the file, add *-OwnerEmail \<your email address\>* to the end of the second command.

## PARAMETERS

### -DoNotPersistEncryptionKey
Prevents a self-granted end user license for the Rights Management issuer from being saved when a file is protected. This license lets the Rights Management issuer open the protected file without authenticating to the Rights Management service. This helps to ensure that the person who ran this cmdlet can always open their own files that they protected, even when that person is offline. It also results in minimal delays for that user to open these protected files.  

The Rights Management issuer is the account that protects the files. For more information, see [Rights Management issuer and Rights Management owner](/information-protection/configure-usage-rights#rights-management-issuer-and-rights-management-owner). 

By default, this self-granted end user license is saved in both the file itself and on the computer from which the cmdlet is run. The file name starts with EUL and it is created in %localappdata%\Microsoft\MSIPC. Use this parameter to prevent this end user license from saving in the file, on the computer, or both. Specifying this parameter is appropriate if you are protecting files on behalf of others, for example, with Windows Server FCI. In this scenario, the Rights Management issuer will not be opening the protected files and therefore creating and saving the end user license decreases the protection performance and unnecessarily generates a lot of files that can fill up the available disk space.

The acceptable values for this parameter:

- **Disk**: An end user license for the Rights Management issuer is not generated for each file in %localappdata%\Microsoft\MSIPC.

- **License**:  An end user license for the Rights Management issuer is not inserted in the publishing license for the file.

- **All**: No end user license for the Rights Management issuer is created and saved when a file is protected.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:
Accepted values: all, disk, license

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -File
Specifies the path and file name to be protected. For the path, you can use a drive letter or UNC.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Folder
Specifies the path and folder to be protected. For the path, you can use a drive letter or UNC.

All the files currently in the specified folder will be protected. New files added to the folder will not be automatically protected.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -InPlace
The file or the files in the specified folder are protected in the current location, replacing the unprotected original file or files. This parameter is ignored if the *OutputFolder* parameter is specified.

If neither *InPlace* nor *OutputFolder* is specified, the new file is created in the current directory with "-Copy" appended to the file name, using the same naming convention that File Explorer uses when a file is copied and pasted into the same folder. For example, if a file with Document.docx is unprotected, the protected version is named Document-Copy.docx. If a file named Document-Copy.docx already exists, Document-Copy(2).docx is created, and so on.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -License
Specifies the variable name that stores an ad hoc rights policy that was created by using the [New-RMSProtectionLicense](./New-RMSProtectionLicense.md) cmdlet. This ad-hoc rights policy is used instead of a template to protect the file or files.

```yaml
Type: SafeInformationProtectionLicenseHandle
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -OutputFolder
Specifies the path and folder to place protected versions of the original files that remain unprotected. The original folder structure is maintained, which means that subfolders might be created for your specified value.

For the path, you can use a drive letter or UNC.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -OwnerEmail
Specifies the Rights Management owner of the protected file or files by email address.

By default, the account running this cmdlet is both the Rights Management issuer and the Rights Management owner of the protected file. This parameter lets you assign a different Rights Management owner to the protected file so that the specified account has all usage rights (Full Control) for the file and can always access it. The Rights Management owner is independent from the Windows file system owner. For more information, see [Rights Management issuer and Rights Management owner](/information-protection/configure-usage-rights#rights-management-issuer-and-rights-management-owner).

If you don't specify a value for this parameter, the cmdlet will use the email address of your authenticated session to identify the Rights Management owner of the protected file or files. If you use AD RMS, or Azure RMS with a user account to protect files, this will be your email address. If you use Azure RMS with a service principal account, this email address will be long string of numbers and letters. This email address is displayed to users who do not have permssions to view the protected document, so that they can request permissions.

If you run this cmdlet for Azure RMS with a service principal account, and you own the file or files that you are protecting, specify your own email address for this parameter. If you run this cmdlet for Azure RMS with a service principal account, and a single user owns the file or all the files that you are protecting, specify their email address so that you do not restrict the original file owner from making changes to the file and using it as intended. 

If you run this cmdlet with multiple files that belong to different users, make sure that those users are granted Full Control usage rights and consider which email address to assign for this parameter. Although you can specify a group email address and this address is displayed to request access permissions, members of the group are not made the Rights Management owner and by default, have no usage rights for the protect file. In this scenario, choose whether to assign a single user (such as an administrator) or specify a group email address that you also assign Full Control usage rights. For the group email configuration, this might be your Help Desk, for example.

Important: Although this parameter is optional, if you do not specify it when you protect files by using Azure RMS and a service principal, the email address that users see from the Azure Information Protection client will not be helpful. Because of this, we recommend that you always specify this parameter when you protect files by using Azure RMS and a service principal rather than your user account.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Recurse
When used with the *Folder* parameter, indicates that all the current files in the subfolders will be protected.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -TemplateID
Specifies the ID of the template to use to protect the specified file or files if you do not use the *License* parameter for an ad-hoc policy. If you do not know the ID of the template that you want to use, use the [Get-RMSTemplate](./Get-RMSTemplate.md) cmdlet.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### CommonParameters
